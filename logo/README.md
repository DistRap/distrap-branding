# Distrap Logo Graphics

## This is a WIP

To use the logo svg files, use in any high contrast setting with no strokes, only fill. The graphics provided are as outlines.

The "full" logo includes the graphic, "DISTRAP" text below, and "distributed rapid prototyping" below that. Use where space allows at larger sizes.

The "mini" logo includes the graphic and "DISTRAP" text below. Use where space is limited, or in stylized versions on larger items.

The "micro" logo includes the grahpic alone. Use where space is very limited and at very small sizes, or in stylized versions on larger items, where "Distrap" is indicated textually otherwise.

The PNG files are supplied as reference.
